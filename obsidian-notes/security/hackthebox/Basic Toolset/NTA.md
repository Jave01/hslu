| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| `HEAD`    | Get more information about the server and it's operational status.                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| `GET`     | Request information and content from the server                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| `POST`    | Submit information to the server                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| `PUT`     | the easiest way to visualize the differences between PUT and POST is to think of it like this; PUT will create or update an object at the URI supplied, while POST will create child entities at the provided URI                                  |     |
| `DELETE`  | Remove the object at the given URI                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| `TRACE`   | Allows for remote server diagnosis. The remote server will echo the same request that was sent in its response if the TRACE method is enabled.                                                                                                     |     |
| `OPTIONS` | The Options method can gather information on the supported HTTP methods the server recognizes. This way, we can determine the requirements for interacting with a specific resource or server without actually requesting data or objects from it. |     |
| `CONNECT` | Connect is reserved for use with Proxies or other security devices like firewalls. Connect allows for tunneling over HTTP.                                                                                                                         |     |
