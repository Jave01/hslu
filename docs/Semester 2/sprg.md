### Approach

Rule of thumb:

- the effort spent for RE should be inverse to the risk that your're able to manage

### What is a requirement?

1. A condtion or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally omposed document
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2)

### Core Activities of RE

1. **Elicitation**: optain requirements from stakeholders and other sources, refine the requirements in greater detail
2. **Documentation**: elicited requirements are described adequately
3. **Validation and negitiation**: documented requirements must be validated and negotiated early on
4. **Management:** structure requirements, prepare them so they can be used in many roles.
